[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=13) f and me being a complete Minecraft nerd I wasn't going to let this slide because you may be thinking oh yeah Steve is kind of strong I watch a game theory video Blah Blah Blah uh no you don't
[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=23) understand how insanely strong Steve is like it's not even funny I ha seing so many people lowballing Steve online so let this be my video PSA on why Steve is incomprehensibly strong and could
[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=35) also solo fiction wait [Music] what mining away okay so after watching some power scaling videos I noticed that there's
[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=49) five main components to measure how strong sonone is the first aspect is raw strength or in our case how much Steve can lift up and carry sure yeah there's been a game theory video made just about
[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=58) this made in 2018 but because times have changed the number that they came up with has became incredibly inaccurate there's actually a lot more that goes into this question than you would even
[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=66) think and no one has covered it yet so let me begin first we need to find out what the heaviest thing Steve could hold is and that would have to be the gold block is what I would say if this was
[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=75) 2018 but no there's actually a block that's seven times heavier than gold and that is netherite but to find out how much a netherite block weighs we could actually use a gold block for reference
[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=84) you see a gold block weighs about 21.3 tons and dividing that by 9 we get to see how much each little gold weighs multiply that by four and we get how much gold is inside netherite but for
[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=93) the nether scrap we don't really know what that is yeah we know it comes from ancient debris which can be found underneath the nether but we don't really know much more than that but
[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=100) taking some low ball assumptions we could assume it was popularly theorized and that theory is basically a bunch of hoglands and what not died and it's just the remains so we could assume that each
[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=109) scrap is at least as heavy as a bone block and after some rather concerning research I found that a 1x1 M Cub of bone would be 2.2 tons why is there a study on this putting this all together
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=119) we could see that one netherite bar is 19 tons and then multiply that by nine and we get the insane weight of 164 tons for one netherite block AKA already the weight of a blue whale now with this
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=130) insane netherite block we could fill up an entire Sher box top to bottom with stacks of it and once we're done filling that up we could use control pick block and that copies the Sher box into your
[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=139) inventory with all of this MBT data and by doing that we are now carrying 284,000 tons in just one Sher box which thing this random guy I found on Kora what we're holding is more than the
[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=148) weight of a sky scraper oh and you think that's impressive because you could actually grab a chest and fill it up with these Sher boxes take that chest into your inventory and you can start
[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=157) filling up another chest with stacks of the previous chest and you can actually continue doing this process with the Pig block technique for a long time until eventually you reach a depth tag limit
[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=165) of the game which is doing this 171 times so after doing that entire process 171 times you should result in a final chest which once again you can multiply this Ser your inventory and also into
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=177) your off hand to get the max stuffies you could hold and uh I I actually have no clue how much this is so I then spent an entire afternoon calculating it all and I wanted to do it all in one sitting
[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=186) because I thought it' be cool for this time laps but in reality it just gave me extreme brain rot but here we are and this is the number I got and uh I went to some random math website and it told
[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=195) me that some this many times seven followed by 618 zeros mhm this website also has a worded out section for my number but it it's only telling me that my number is too big even as I scroll
[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=207) and after some further more calculations I found out that saying our number is heavier than the observable universe is an understatement our number is so big that Steve could basically hold this
[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=216) many universes and even this number is so big I can't even visualize it going back to the one website it basically says I had 6 67 1888 ilon mini universes I don't even know what that number is
[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=228) that Steve could just carry around but another thing is the Minecraft Earth is different than our Earth which means that the gravity that Steve experiences is different than the gravity that we
[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=236) experience and this could affect that how much he feels his weighing so I set up this experiment to determine how strong gravity is by determining the Sand's rate of acceleration now all I
[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=244) got to do is press this button and ah so I don't need to do my own research thank you internet anyways if we take our previous number of tons and then multiply by the new Gravity we get oh oh
[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=258) [Music] no okay cool now that you're beginning to understand just the stupidity of of how strong Steve is let's head over to speed to start off I buil to 100 block
[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=274) race SC to see how fast Steve Sprint jump was and after recording a quick clip where I ran it all I put that clip into my editing software and cropped out the exact points where it begins and
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=282) finishes and it told me that it took 14.4 seconds Force to run 100 blocks or in other words 15.5 mph which to be clear each block in Minecraft has a 1 cubed meter correlation to real life and
[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=293) in real life the 100 m dash record is we already one of the fastest people in the world but no no we could go faster since we're in Creative I tried getting a base fly test speed which came out to
[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=306) be 5.07 seconds AKA 44 mph but steeve could still fly a lot faster than that by going in spectator not many people know this by by scrolling up on your mouse you could actually turn up your
[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=316) acceleration speed and you could actually go extremely fast with this so after struggling to get on the dang starting platform I eventually launched myself so fast I zipped past the finish
[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=325) line and accidentally started loading out new chunks behind it and just to see how fast that was it was 1.42 seconds to reach it AK 157 mph which in real life is as fast as a sky diver going head
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=336) first out of a plane but now we reached a point where there's only one way to go faster drugs in Minecraft as we all know there are potion effects when splashed with
[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=349) one of these Speed 2 potions we get a 40% speed increase but that number is nothing by doing slash effects you can actually boost yourself off with speed 255 but I noticed in order to test it we
[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=359) need a better Runway than the small dinky thing so let me introduce you to the considerably larger version which I built a 10,000 block track for and only Cuts Ser staggering five God dang
[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=370) Villages because my dumb dumb head forgot to turn off Village spawns on this world ending this track off with a golden pad to stop me so by going to the beginning of the track I gave myself

[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=386) speed of the clouds above me as I run but once I reach a line I threw the clip into premere Pro and it ended up taking 3415 seconds and after doing some brief calculations it ends up being 655 mph
[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=398) which is basically the speed of sound we are casually walking faster than a literal plane but the thing is you could still go faster than this in Minecraft you could actually slash attribute your
[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=407) speed to become your new base but unlike the speed effects earlier that cap out at 255 for this we could just yeah and now with just one little click of the W key I immediately run off
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=418) the course of the entire face to the Earth and eventually I just lag backwards a few thousand blocks cuz my PC can't handle it look if I hold down W and continue running my PC absolutely

[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=437) ground underneath us but by looking at this footage frame by frame we could actually see a few numbers so record them down on a graphing calculator and you could see I actually start slowing
[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=444) down right after the first frame because by then I've already fully ran outside the blocks rendering around me meaning in the 0.01 second I was able to touch ground I ran 1,3 M which is the

[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=560) second well on which modern physics is based nothing in the universe can travel faster than light Alber tell you light speed is the fast thing in the universe it is the closest thing to instant light
[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=572) speed is so stupidly fast it's been theorized by achieving even up to a tenth of it space in time itself will begin to work yeah so we achieved six times the speed of life I mean it's only
[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=582) 4 bli 1996 mil 84,3 12 mph I don't know oh wait hear this by achieving faster than light speeds you'll achieve infinite Mass which means you'll then achieve infinite
[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=594) Force which means you also then have infinite damage so uh that's something [Music] wow uh I I haven't posted in a while I have to hurry this video up okay now
[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=612) moving on to durability so you may think that creative SE is actually Invincible which is mostly true things like the void as I said earlier are easily survivable with just some regeneration
[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=621) so just to make it somewhat Fair we're going to use survival mode Steve for durability but first we need something that could cause damage in game so that we can measure it in real life and for
[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=629) that there is TNT that thing that also exists in real life now although it is a 1 cubic met little bomb that doesn't actually mean anything we need to find out how much damage it actually packs
[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=639) when it explodes so I created a custom R just made out of stone and I dug into the ground to make this giant stone wall and what I did is I made a little tunnel inside the giant stone wall spawned in a
[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=649) piece of TNT and then quickly patched it up then once the TNT goes off I could go into spectator and I could start seeing how much Stone the TNT actually blew up by how much Cobblestone it broke I
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=659) didn't repeat this process nine more times and I put all the numbers onto an average calculator yes I use a calculator to find the average it's more time efficient okay and it told me that
[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=667) 30.9 was the average Stone Broken per TNT now thanks to some Elon mus ascendant on Reddit they calculated how much jewels of power would be need to destroy a 1 cubic M cube of limestone
[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=677) but that's for Limestone and the stone that we have in Minecraft is clearly not Limestone now thanks of some more plagiarized studies I stole a stone called riy is theorized to be the rock
[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=686) we see in the game and something called the mooss scale tells us that rolite is 2.4 times harder than Limestone so we can then multiply the Jews need to blow up Limestone by 2.4 and then multiply
[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=695) that again by the 30.9 average Stone Broken in our experiment and there now we know that there is 574 million je of power per TNT explosion or a real life equivalent of
[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=707) 96 sticks of dynamite which is cool and all but this is what a nuclear bomb would look like if it was in Minecraft this cuy was filled up with 8,000 blocks of TNT or in other words 4.59 trillion
[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=720) jewels of potential energy and now I'm going to light it on [Music] myself how the heck did I survive that without a single scratch with no armor
[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=737) in Survival Mode well it's pretty easy I just gave myself Max resistance before setting it off no no no surely I could deal at least some damage to myself come on ink crystals I found have a bigger
[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=748) explosion than TNT so by doing the same methods as before I found out that each in Crystal has 8817 million Jews of energy so I set up a little experiment where I set up nine command blocks all
[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=757) with the same purpose to spawn ink crystals on me so after giving myself resistance I turned them all on and I stood in the middle as I watched it instantly climbing number of ink
[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=765) crystals spawning around me and on the top left where it says e you can actually see how many ink crystals are being spawned around me so as I sat there my frame slowly became more and
[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=773) more AIDS until it reached a point where I felt like my PC was about to crash so I started to spam hit and then eventually once we reached 24598 ink crystals the hits went through
[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=783) and I started exploding only to all do literally no damage so with the 24598 in crystals I spawned I did some calculating and I found out that the explosion I just with took was actually
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=794) stronger than the bomb that took out all of Pima 1945 I don't feel good saying that and that's still without even using glitched OP armor or super strong attributes I
[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=803) don't understand how strong is Steve with resistance oh Steve is Invincible past only resist resistance 5 Steve is literally [Music]
[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=820) Immortal what do I even say anymore if you made it this far and you still aren't convinced that Steve could destroy 99.99% of fiction I'm just going to speed around a few more insane things
[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=831) Steve could do so at the test strength I recoded the warden's HP from 500 to this number which is 10 to the 305th power Time 5 with the inner dragon's HP and with just strength alone Steve could
[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=842) literally one shot this with his fist oh and just for the fun of it let's turn this infinitely strong hit using attribute into this which it may not look like much but I'm actually hitting
[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=851) an infinite amount of times every second and just to show you how stupid this is I made an entire pool of these stupidly strong wardens and I jumped in and I immediately defeated them all with ease
[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=861) oh and with the execute command you can actually go between Dimensions making Steve interdimensional or multiversal by just joining other worlds and servers and Steve could also bring his items too
[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=870) using the safed inventory feature possess his time manipulation with/ time he could literally just do a quick command to create World eating barriers he has access to the secret Minecraft
[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=880) item known as the knowledge book which allows you to know all the crafting recipes can alter matter itself using the debug stick or it could just destroy it all with the/ Bill command and for
[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=888) height not only is he 6'2 on the Bedrock version of the game you could do SL playay animation and you could literally make yourself a giant he could create literal nukes with Fireballs he could
[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=897) literally slash summon anything or if he doesn't feel like doing that he could use glitched eggs to summon other things I know this looks extremely cursed and if he still really needs to he could
[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=906) just use a command block to instantly kill everything around him regardless of durability yeah so not only is Steve strong but he is a literal God so what katos could flip nine Realms Steve could
[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=915) literally hold the entire Multiverse Dooms could resist getting shot with the BFG 10K but that's still nothing compared to infinite durability oh but Goku could teleport at the speed of
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=924) light well guess what Steve goes six times the speed of light you get what I'm getting at Steve should be able to destroy any one and everything in fiction besides enties like TOA and
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XflmrrdTNk&feature=endscreen&source_ve_path=MTAwNDU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comif&t=932) whatnot so I don't want to hear anyone say that creative Steve is overrated or weak ever again goodbye
