<p>Changez Khan --- with mere swords, arrows and horses, and with NO fighter planes, tanks, atom bombs and not even cannons or guns --- killed almost as many people as world war 2 Back then , population of world was below 80 crore&nbsp;!!! And Changez Khan  killed 5 crore people&nbsp;!!!
</p><p>in WW2 , world population was 300 crore and number of deaths in WW2 were abound 6 crore. So Changez Khan was almost close and much much higher on&nbsp;% basis. And much higher, if one sees the fact he had only ordinary weapons and no advanced weapons.
</p>
<hr>
<p>But he rarely killed engineers , technicians and craftsman (craftsman, not artists)\\
He once captured city of Merv in Iran. The population was 5 lakhs, which makes it a megacity by standard of those days. He ordered slaughter of ALL , except some 500 engineers <br>

<i>"Genghis now turned his attention to Merv, an oasis city of mosques and mansions. Its ten libraries contained 150,000 volumes, the greatest collection in Central Asia. The Mongols entered the city and after separating 400 craftsmen and a crowd of children to act as slaves, drove the remaining population on to the plain.</i>"\\
//The word craftsman means engineers, technicians etc//. Not only Changez Khan didnt kill engineers ,  he used to make them equal citizens , not slaves. And he also spared family members of engineers etc. He used to give them better deals then they used to.\\
You can guess the reasons why Changez didn't kill engineers etc. 
</p>
<ul><li><ul><li>Because engineers make weapons.** \\</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Changez Khan was illiterate&nbsp;!! He had NO primary school education, forget university education. But it appears that he had a great common sense. He could see that engineering , particularly weapon making, is more useful than arts, rituals, dances, music, creative writings and other things.\\
</p>
<hr>
<p>USA too when it captured Germany, didnt kill scientists and engineers. And gave them US citizenship. Once German scientists who made missiles which killed several Britons and a quire a few Americans was Warner Brown. After a few days of imprisonment, USA gave him US citizenship&nbsp;!!! Warner Brown was principal scientist in making rockets at NASA which sent several satellites in orbits and also sent man on moon (which we now know was hoax). \\
</p>
<hr>
<p>Engineering doesnt improve much by college education and finances, Engineering improves by competition and low-harassment environments. i.e. a factory owner should face minimal harassment from govts / society , and at the same time, he should NOT have liberty to exploit his own labor, because one of the labor is going to become his competitor and give more benefits to society. So harassment to factory owner worsens present of the society . but giving oppurtunity to factory owner to over exploit his labor worsens FUTURE of the society&nbsp;!! So question is what legal structure will reduce harasssment on factory owner and at the same time reduce his ability to exploit his labor?
